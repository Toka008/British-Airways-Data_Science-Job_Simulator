# British Airways Data Science Job Simulator
- Uncover company insights and predict customer buying behaviour with our Data Science team.

## Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights

## Context
- Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways
  
## Expected Outcomes
- Scrape and collect customer feedback by analysing third-party data
- Determine review trends
- Create a system to classify opinions regarding various review kinds.
- Present your insights in using PowerPoint

## Tools Used
- Python(Beautiful soup for web scraping)
- Python(Numpy,Pandas and Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Powerpoint

- Topic : The word cloud below shows key topics in the reviews includes ‘service’, ‘flight’, ‘seat’ , ‘customer service’,  which indicates customers are actively discussing customer service and their experiences.

## Conclusion
- British Airways can enhance customer experience and aviation industry competitiveness by proactively addressing pain points, capitalizing on positive aspects, and implementing continuous monitoring practices.
- The analysis's findings guide immediate enhancements and serve as a foundation for continuous improvements, emphasizing the significance of data-driven insights in driving operational excellence and enhancing customer experience.

## Recommendation
- The focus of negative attitudes is frequently operational problems, particularly delayed flights. By addressing these issues, overall service reliability can be greatly improved.
- Create a strong customer feedback loop to enable ongoing observation. Maintain a proactive approach to customer satisfaction by routinely gathering and evaluating consumer input to spot changing trends and address new issues.
- Sustainably good experiences are ensured by establishing a culture of constant improvement based on client feedback.

## Task 2: Predicting customer buying behaviour

## Context
- Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour

## Expected Outcomes
- Prepare a dataset
- Train a machine learning model
- Evaluate and present your findings

## Tools Used
- Python(Numpy,Pandas and Matplotlib)
- Python(Scikit learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Powerpoint

## Output
![feature_importance](https://github.com/Toka008/git-primer/assets/63381061/d2191137-5411-4cb0-a0e7-5b1d280ddc9d)
- The random forest model ranks purchase_lead (the interval between purchase and departure) as the most significant feature, followed by flight_hour, length_of_stay, flight_duration, and flight_duration.
- Details concerning the flight, such as its duration and time, were also vital, although the customer's booking origin(Continent) was not.


## Conclusion
- The results of the analysis emphasize the value of data-driven insights in promoting operational excellence and improving customer experience, and they serve as a basis for both immediate changes and ongoing improvements.
- The Random Forest model was chosen due to its interpretability, feature importance, adaptability, ability to handle diverse datasets, and resilience to overfitting.
- Strong predictive capability is ensured by the study of feature importance, which highlights critical predictions and areas requiring additional research. This improves model performance on both observed and unseen data.

## Recommendation
- Examine and perhaps remove elements that are not very important and only slightly add to the overall efficacy of the model.
- Examine whether the Random Forest model's parameters may be adjusted to potentially boost prediction accuracy.
- To keep the model accurate and relevant, update it frequently in response to new data patterns and changing client booking behavior.
- If you think that adding more pertinent attributes will help to improve the predictions, think about growing the dataset.
