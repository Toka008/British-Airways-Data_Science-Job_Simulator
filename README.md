## Model Evaluation

- The model's accuracy, which required more development, was roughly 0.7 in Precision and 0.003 in Recall. More customer-centric elements should be included in the model, in my opinion.
- Based on these measurements, it seems that the model works well in the Negative class(Class 0). However, as the precision, recall, and F1-score for the negative class (Class 1) are lower, the performance is poorer.

## Output

- The random forest model ranks purchase_lead (the interval between purchase and departure) as the most significant feature, followed by flight_hour, length_of_stay, flight_duration, and flight_duration.
- Details concerning the flight, such as its duration and time, were also vital, although the customer's booking origin(Continent) was not.
